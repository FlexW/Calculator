# math-parser-
A recursive math parser

This is math parser, that I have written to understand how a parser works.

Error handling is not to well and is not meant to be used in the real world. 
It's for learning purpose. 
Also note that the datatype double that I used is not precise enough for a real calculator.

However, you can improve it.

To build it simple run the make script. Should be straightforward.
